        "Isi Lengkap": "As the name implies,Legong Bapang Saba is a legong dance with a style typical of Saba Village, created by I Gusti Bagus Jelantik in the 1930s. This dance depicts the beauty of two angels, Dewi Supraba and Wilotama. However, in terms of presentation, this dance emphasizes the loud character of a legong performance. So there is a harmonious blend in every movement of this dance that builds the beauty of the Legong Bapang Saba dance package.In its performance, this dance is generally danced by two female dancers. However, this dance can also be created to be performed in groups because there is no difference in motion between one dancer and another.The costumes used in the Legong Bapang Saba dance are not much different from the costumes in the Legong Keraton dance with the dominant green color and using properties in the form of fans.This dance is still often performed in various activities. One of them is in the series of Bali Arts Festival (PKB) XLV 2023 at the Art Center Denpasar. This dance can be learned by anyone from various age ranges. Starting from children to adults can learn this dance. In the past, this dance was even performed abroad such as Italy, Germany, London, and France.Learning Legong Saba Dance (Source: Personal Collection)Although it has existed since the 1930s, this dance is still growing and even continues to be passed down to younger generations today.One of the studios that consistently provides Legong Bapang Saba dance training to children in Saba Village in particular is Sanggar Saba Sari. Based on an interview with the dance coach of Sanggar Seni Saba Sari, I Gusti Ngurah Agung Giri Putra or familiarly called Gung Giri, he saidthat in the past, before becoming a studio, this community was called Sekaa Legong which had existed since 1911 and continued to develop until now into Sanggar Seni Saba Sari.The studio is intended for people in Saba Village who want to learn the arts, especially balinese dance.Children who learn at Sanggar Saba Sari are free of charge, but there is a saving system in this studio,where the savings collected will later be given back to them for activities organized by the studio such as farewells or level increases for the needs of the event.Through this studio, children not only gain skills in the field of dance, but their character is also formed by being taught good ethics and being accustomed to saving money since childhood.Saba Sari Art Studio (Source: Personal Collection)The existence of this studio is a form of dedication from Puri in Saba as an effort to preserve arts and culture to children in Saba Village, especially to continue to preserve Saba's distinctive art, namely Legong Bapang Saba Dance. All children who are members of this studio will definitely be taught Legong Bapang Saba Dance, but the development of the child will be seen first.As a young generation, we should take part in the preservation of existing arts and culture. So that what has been passed down by our ancestors can remain sustainable and can be enjoyed by our future generations.Culture is a bridge between the past and the future that we must protect so that it does not collapse.\nIn its performance, this dance is generally danced by two female dancers.

        "Isi Lengkap": "Dwarapala originates from ancient Hindu traditions that began in India.The term Dwarapala in Sanskrit means \"gatekeeper\" (dwara means gate, and pala means guardian). In India, Dwarapala statues were placed at Hindu temples to protect sacred spaces from negative energies and malevolent beings. Through the influence of Hindu-Buddhist culture, this tradition spread to various regions in Asia, including Indonesia.In the Indonesian archipelago, particularly in Java and Bali, Dwarapala statues became known during the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms such as Singasari and Majapahit. Large and majestic Dwarapala statues are often found at Hindu-Buddhist archaeological sites in Java. In Bali, the presence of Dwarapala has been preserved to this day as an essential part of temple architecture, safeguarding the spiritual and physical harmony of sacred spaces.Right-Side Dwarapala Statue (Photo Source: Personal Collection)Dwarapala statues are always placed in pairs on the right and left sides of the temple gate, each carrying distinct symbolic meanings.The Dwarapala on the right side typically represents active energy, masculinity, and the sun (pinggala).This energy is associated with strength, assertiveness, and aggressive protection. Its posture often reflects readiness to act, and its expression is more dynamic, exuding a dominant aura.Right-Side Dwarapala Statue (Photo Source: Personal Collection)Conversely, the Dwarapala on the left side symbolizes passive energy, femininity, and the moon (ida bagia).This energy embodies gentleness, intuition, and receptivity. Its posture is calmer, with a more serene facial expression, though still vigilant. Cosmologically, the right-side Dwarapala is connected to the elements of fire or light, while the left-side Dwarapala is associated with water or shadow.Together, their presence reflects the concept of Rwa Bhineda, a duality that complements each other.This concept teaches that in life, there are two opposing forces—light and dark, active and passive, masculine and feminine—that must be balanced. The right and left Dwarapala work together to create harmony, protecting and sanctifying the temple grounds.Although Dwarapala is part of an ancient tradition, its meaning remains relevant in modern life. These statues teach the importance of maintaining balance between active and passive energies in human life. Furthermore, the presence of Dwarapala serves as a symbol of protection, reminding people to always guard the purity of their hearts and minds against negative influences.\nIn the Indonesian archipelago, particularly in Java and Bali, Dwarapala statues became known during the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms such as Singasari and Majapahit.

        "Isi Lengkap": "On a stunning beach in Bali stands a masterpiece reflecting the noble spiritual and cultural values of Hindu Bali:Triratna Amertha Bhuwana. These three majestic statues are the focal point, embodying the philosophy ofTriratna. Each element holds profound meaning, serving as a guide for harmonious living among humans, nature, and God. These statues are not only spiritual symbols but also tourist attractions, evoking admiration for their blend of art, philosophy, and breathtaking natural beauty. Against the backdrop of crystal-clear blue seas, white sand, and gentle ocean breezes,Triratna Amertha Bhuwanaoffers both inner peace and inspiration.Ratu Manik Kencana Sari Dewi and Hyang Mahaurip (Photo Source: Personal Collection)The statue ofKanjeng Ratu Manik Kencana Sari Dewi, often associated with Nyi Roro Kidul, stands majestically by the seaside. As the ruler of the southern sea, this statue symbolizes the ocean's power, prosperity, and beauty. Intricate carvings depict waves, representing the sea's depth and energy. The statue serves as a reminder to visitors that the ocean is a vital part of human life, a source of livelihood, and a guardian of ecological balance. It also instills a sense of reverence for nature, especially the sea, as part of Bali’s traditions and beliefs.In the center of the complex stands the tallest statue,Hyang Mahaurip, symbolizingAmreta Jiwapurity, sanctity, and wisdom.

        "Isi Lengkap": "Topeng Sidakarya is a sacred performing art from Bali that was included in theUNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia list in 2015. The name\"Topeng Sidakarya\"consists of the words\"topeng\" meaning maskand\"Sidakarya,\" which means achieving a goal or completing a task.Therefore,Topeng Sidakarya symbolizes the success in accomplishing a task or work well.Today,this dance is part of the Yadnya ceremonies in Bali,wherethe Sidakarya dance is always performed before the worship ceremony to ensure the smoothness and safety of the ritual.At the end of the performance,the dancers scatter coins and yellow rice as a symbol of blessings for perfection and prosperity.The written source that uncovers the history ofDalem Sidakarya is the Bebali Sidakarya manuscript, a collection of Ida Pedanda Gede Nyoman Gunung from Biau, andthe Babad Sidakarya, written by I Nyoman Kantun, S.H., M.H., and Drs. I Ketut Yadnya. According to these sources, in a village inKeling, East Java,there was a renowned priest with the\"Liberation of the Soul\"knowledge known asBrahmana Keling. Brahmana Keling was the son of Dang Hyang Kayumanis, the grandson of Empu Candra, and the great-grandson of Empu Beradah, belonging to an honorable Brahmana family.He established a hermitage on the slopes of Mount Bromo and then went to Bali after hearing from his father thatKing Dalem Waturenggong, who ruled the Gelgel Palace,was inPura Besakih preparing for a ceremony. Upon arriving at Pura Besakih, Brahmana Keling was met with doubt by the temple attendants, who did not immediately recognize him as the king's brother.Brahmana Keling ( Source: Personal Collection )Brahmana Keling, who was not acknowledged by the royal attendants,entered Pura Besakih andrested in the shrine due to exhaustion.When King Waturenggong arrived and saw him in tattered clothing, he mistakenly thought Brahmana Keling was a madman and had him expelled.Feeling disrespected,Brahmana Keling uttered a curse: \"Wastu tata astu, karya yang dilaksanakan tan sidakarya (not successful), bumi kekeringan, rakyat kekeringan, sarwa gumatat-gumititi ngrubeda,\" before leaving Pura Besakih and heading towards Desa Sidakarya.Not long after the curse was spoken,Bali was struck by plagues and pests.Dang Hyang Nirarta, who tried to perform a ceremony to seek safety, was unsuccessful.Feeling guilty for expelling his brother,King Waturenggong meditated and received guidance that only Brahmana Keling could restore the situation.The people were then sent to find Brahmana Keling, and he was eventuallylocated in Bandanda Negara, now known as Desa Sidakarya.Brahmana Keling agreed to restore the situation to its previous state.Ida Ratu Dalem Waturenggong ( Source: Personal Collection )To commemorate the services of Brahmana Keling, known as Dalem Sidakarya,Dalem Waturenggong orderedthe construction of Pura Dalem Sidakarya in 1518 AD.Since then, Hindu worshippers in Bali are required toseek \"tirta penyida karya\" (holy water for success in ceremonies) at Pura Dalem Sidakarya to ensure the success of their rituals.Additionally, every religiousceremony in Bali is accompanied by a performance of Topeng Sidakarya as part of honoring and completing significant Hindu rituals.Topeng Sidakarya CharactersThe Topeng Sidakarya dance features various distinctive mask characters, each carrying its own philosophical meaning.White MaskThe white mask symbolizes thatDalem Sidakarya is a holy person. White is also consideredsymbolic of deities and Brahmanas.Narrow Eyes MaskThe narrow eyes symbolizeself-reflection and attentiveness to the surroundings.In yoga, narrow eyes also representcontrol and mental concentration.Fierce Teeth MaskThis mask looks frightening, and at first, one might think it has a bad meaning. However,the fierce teeth mask symbolizes simplicity.Half-Demonic Face MaskThis mask representsRwa Bhineda,the duality of existence.Both characters must be balanced, as the demonic/violent nature can be transformed into human traits.Long Hair MaskLong hair isinterpreted as a symbol of being free, whilewhite hair signifies purity.Ida Bhatara Dalem ( Source: Personal Collection )TheTopeng SidakaryaDance servesnot only as a medium to remember the history and tragedy of Brahmana Kelingbut alsoas a spiritual tool in the daily lives of Hindus in Bali.Through this performance,the Balinese community can reflect on the balance between spiritual power and human values, whilemaintaining a harmonious relationship with nature and one another.\nThe written source that uncovers the history ofDalem Sidakarya is the Bebali Sidakarya manuscript, a collection of Ida Pedanda Gede Nyoman Gunung from Biau, andthe Babad Sidakarya, written by I Nyoman Kantun, S.H., M.H., and Drs.
